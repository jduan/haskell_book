-- 1.
type IntString = (Int, String)

instance TooMany (Int, String) where
  tooMany (n, s) = n > 42

instance TooMany (Int, Int) where
  tooMany (x, y) = x + y > 42

-- I don't fully understand how to use this
instance (Num a, TooMany a) => TooMany (a, a) where
  tooMany (x, y) = tooMany x || tooMany y

Function type is exponential

Given a function a -> b, we can calculate the inhabitants with the formula b^a.

For a -> b -> c, we get (c ^ b) ^ a == c ^ (b * a) inhabitants.

For example:

data Quantum
  = Yes
  | No
  | Both
  deriving (Show, Eq)

convert :: Quantum -> Bool
convert = undefined

According to a -> b and b^a, there should be 2^3 or 8 implementations of this
function.

convert Yes = ?
convert No = ?
convert Both = ?

You can replace ? with True or False and there are 2 * 2 * 2 = 2^3 = 8 different
ways of doing that.


Exercises: The Quad

Determine how many unique inhabitants each type has.

1. 8
eQuad :: Either Quad Quad

2. 4 * 4 = 16
prodQuad :: (Quad, Quad)

3. 4^4 = 256
funcQuad :: Quad -> Quad

4. 2 * 2 * 2 = 8
prodTBool :: (Bool, Bool, Bool)

5. 2 ^ (2 * 2) = 16
gTwo :: Bool -> Bool -> Bool

6. 4 ^ (4 * 2) = 65536
fTwo :: Bool -> Quad -> Quad
